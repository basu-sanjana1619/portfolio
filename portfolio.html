<p>I would like to introduce myself as a <b>Computer Science Engineer</b> with almost three years professional experience 
working 
in IT sector. Due to family responsibilities, I had to take a break in my career. 
But now that things are settled I am ready to back to work and restart 
my career again.
<br>
I have a huge passion for learning, reading and writing and during my career break, I learnt few 
programming language, concepts and studied about fields other than programming. In 2020 and in the beginning of 2021, 
I wrote and published few educational books which I feel extremely proud of.</p>
